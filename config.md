description: "The guitar is a plucked string instrument. The strings are arranged parallel to the soundboard and neck, usually cut off from frets, on which the strings are supported with one hand to produce different notes. The other hand pinches the strings, either with the nails and fingertips or with a plectrum (or mediator). The guitar most often has six strings.

The guitar is the most common European version of the organological category of the neck box lute. It differs from similar instruments (balalaika, bouzouki, charango, lute, mandolin, oud, theorbo, ukulele) mainly by its shape, and secondarily by the number of strings and their most usual chord. Some guitar variants are called, regionally, by particular names: viola, viol√£o, cavaco and cavaquinho (Brazil); tiple and requinto (Latin America)...

The hollow body of the guitar, generally called the resonance box, transforms the vibration of the strings into sound waves. We make several types of guitars that can differ in their ambitus and timbre while sharing most of their playing techniques. The trunk is most often made of wood but can also be made of metal and, more recently, of composite material plastic-carbon fibre. The electric guitar, derived from the guitar during the 20th century, can dispense with hollow bodies, which makes it a new instrument that includes an electronic amplifier and loudspeaker, with possibilities for timbre variations far beyond the acoustic guitar, in all its variants1.

The guitar, easily transportable, is an instrument that accompanies singing in many popular musical genres. Often the singer accompanies himself on his guitar. European classical music has provided a repertoire for guitar; it is also a characteristic flamenco instrument where it accompanies singing and dancing. The Brazilian choro, the mariachi music in Mexico integrate it into ensembles.

Its popularity, already established in recent centuries, has increased with the international distribution of American music in the 20th century: jazz, blues, country, pop, rock, reggae, soul. The guitar is found in modern interpretations of African, Latin or Celtic music. Along with piano, harmonica and violin, it is one of the most widely used instruments in the world."
