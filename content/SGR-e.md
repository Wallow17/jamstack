description: "Making the 7-string world accessible is what this SGR by Schecter offers.
It follows the classic C7 line and its curved table gives good access to the 24 squares of its handle. Despite its ultra-competitive price, the finishes are remarkable, especially the handle and the lamination, which are very careful. Passive Schecter microphones produce warm, harmonically rich tones. She will be as comfortable with clear sound as with high saturation. 
A real 7 strings, beautiful and playable to explore new musical worlds."
